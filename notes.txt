### Usability, Accessibility, and Overall Interaction Effectiveness

**Usability**: ClassWeaver offers an intuitive Streamlit UI where users upload JSON/XML files, select a language (Java, C++, C#), set a root class name, and download a ZIPâ€”all in under 30 seconds, ideal for hackathon pacing.

**Accessibility**: Runs locally with a single command (`streamlit run src/app.py`), requiring only Python and internet for setup, ensuring broad compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux as of August 13, 2025, 07:51 PM IST.

**Interaction Effectiveness**: The clean interface minimizes clicks, provides clear feedback (e.g., error messages), and delivers consistent, editable code, enhancing developer productivity and satisfaction.
