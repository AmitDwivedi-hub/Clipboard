### Readiness for Real-World Execution, Practicality, and Deployment Complexity

**Readiness**: ClassWeaver is ready for real-world use, handling complex JSON/XML data (e.g., nested lists) and generating functional classes in Java, C++, and C# as of August 13, 2025, 08:03 PM IST, with successful testing on sample datasets.

**Practicality**: Its modular design and Streamlit UI make it practical for developers, requiring minimal setup (Python + `requirements.txt`) and offering immediate ZIP downloads, ideal for prototyping and education.

**Deployment Complexity**: Deployment is low-complexityâ€”runs locally with `streamlit run src/app.py` or can be hosted on free platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud with minor configuration, avoiding server costs or intricate scaling needs.
