Rapid Prototyping for Developers

Description: Developers can quickly convert sample JSON or XML data (e.g., API responses) into object classes in Java, C++, or C# during the initial stages of a project. This speeds up prototyping by eliminating manual class creation.

Data Migration and Integration

Description: Facilitates the migration of legacy data (e.g., XML-based systems) into modern object-oriented applications by generating compatible classes, streamlining integration with databases or APIs.

API Development and Testing

Description: Enables developers to generate model classes from API schema definitions (e.g., Swagger JSON) for request/response handling, accelerating backend development and testing.
Example: A team building a REST API uses ClassWeaver to create C++ classes from a JSON schema, ensuring consistent data models across the project.
