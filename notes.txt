### Potential for Deployment in Similar Projects and Reusability as an Asset

**Deployment Potential**: ClassWeaver is highly adaptable for similar projects, such as data-to-code converters for other languages (e.g., Python, TypeScript) or integration into )*

# Dockerfile (place at repo root)

# Use an official slim Python image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Prevents Python from buffering stdout/stderr (useful for logs)
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PORT=8080

# Install OS packages required for many Python packages and for runtime tools
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
       build-essential \
       gcc \
       curl \
       libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements files (if present)
COPY requirements.txt src/requirements.txt* ./

# Upgrade pip and install any requirements found.
# This checks for both root requirements.txt and src/requirements.txt and installs whichever exist.
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel \
    && /bin/sh -c 'if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt; fi' \
    && /bin/sh -c 'if [ -f src/requirements.txt ]; then pip install --no-cache-dir -r src/requirements.txt; fi'

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . /app

# Create a non-root user and switch to it
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash appuser \
    && chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

# Expose the port that the app will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Use Gunicorn with Uvicorn worker for production (adjust WORKERS as needed)
# - src.app:app assumes your FastAPI application is at src/app.py and defines `app`
CMD ["sh", "-c", "exec gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --workers ${WORKERS:-2} src.app:app"]


### Economic Viability: Evaluating Costs, Revenue Generation, and Financial Risks

**Costs**: ClassWeaver’s development leverages free tools (Python, Streamlit, built-in libraries), with minimal costs for hosting (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud is free) or maintenance as of August 13, 2025, 08:10 PM IST, keeping initial investment low.

**Revenue Generation**: Potential revenue streams include a premium subscription (e.g., cloud features, advanced languages), licensing to IDE vendors, or ad-supported free tiers, targeting developers and enterprises willing to pay for efficiency.

**Financial Risks**: Risks are low—open-source distribution mitigates market rejection, but limited initial user base and competition from established tools (e.g., JSON-to-Pojo) require marketing efforts. Scaling costs could rise with demand, manageable with phased growth.
